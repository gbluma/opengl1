*This application is not necessarily a good example of what you should do 
when writing OpenGL apps in Haskell.*  This is *just* a project I like
to play on to learn haskell and explore some functional programming with OpenGL.

I try to keep this code in working order -- so it should compile if you want to
take a look at it -- but it is not idiomatic, nor is it performance oriented. 

If you have questions about this project, I'd be happy to entertain them.
