# List of things that I need to work on.

* Refactor Scene Management into its own module
  - Loadable file for textures/models/etc.
  - entering scene, exiting scene, etc.
  - layering one scene on top of another (menus?)
  - Actually including a Scene Graph
* Apply more than one texture to a cube (multitexturing)
* Prepare engine for Vertex Shaders
* Prepare engine for Pixel Shaders
* Refactor code so it is idiomatic:
  - Possibly imitate to some degree (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/OpenGLTutorial2)
  - Consider using reactive-glut 
* Consider using Cairo for text/HUD


# Recently Finished Items

* Display FPS (happens in console)
* Load Images from File (uncompressed)
* Apply Textures to a cube
* Setup Basic Lighting in Scene [done]
* Refactor World into its own module
  - separate world state from engine state
